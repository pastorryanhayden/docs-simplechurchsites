When you open the prayer tool, you will see three lists in the toolbar:

## Active

These are the prayer requests that show up on the prayer page you share with your church and that print on the handout.

## Archive

These are prayer requests that are no longer on the active list either because you took them off or they were automatically archived.  Archived requests are not deleted - you can easily put them back with one button.

## Pending

The pending list is for prayer requests that have been added by church members who are not administrators.  Pending requests have to be approved before they show up on the active list.  The pending tab will show a badge with the number of pending requests that you have and you should also get a notification via email whenever a user submits a pending request.
