## Adding Requests

To add a request, press the blue "+" button on the bottom left of the screen.  You simply add the details of the request and choose a category.

This has been designed to allow you to rapidly add multiple requests using only your keyboard with the tab key so that you can use this during a prayer meeting.  Unfortunately, the tabbing doesn't work properly in Safari or Firefox, but they work in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.

When you are finished addding requests, you can just click the "x" in the top right or simply click off of the white box.

## Editing Requests

To edit a request, simply press the Edit button on that request and change the details.

## Archiving, Deleting, or Activating Multiple Requests

You may want to archive, delete or activate multiple requests.  To do this, simply click on the checkbox on each request, and then select the appropriate option on the popup at the bottom of the screen.
