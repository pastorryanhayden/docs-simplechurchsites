## Managing Everything But Sermons

To manage anything but sermons, simply go to your website and add `/update` to the URL.  So if your website is `genericchurchwebsite.com` you would type `genericchurchwebsite.com/update` and hit enter.  Then you just enter your church password and you should be able to update everything.

## Managing Sermons

Sermons are managed through **Airtable.**  To login to manage sermons use your Airtable username and password.  You can create extra Airtable users and share your Sermons base with them so that they can update sermons as well.
