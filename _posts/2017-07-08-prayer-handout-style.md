You can change the Handout style for prayer in the prayer settings. (Either click the gear icon in the tool list or choose settings from the prayer toolbar.)

We offer three styles of handouts:

* **Half letter** prints two handouts on a letter sized piece of paper and is probably enough for most churches.
* If you have more prayer requests, you may want to choose **letter**, which will take up an entire sheet of paper and give you lots of room for requests.
* If you prefer a booklet like a traditional bulletin, you can choose **booklet** and print your requests as a folded buletin.

After you've decided on your settings, be sure to click the "Save Settings" button.
