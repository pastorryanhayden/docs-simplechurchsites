These are all of the prayer settings you can change. (Either click the gear icon in the tool list or choose settings from the prayer toolbar.)

## Categories

We use these categories in my church:

* Health Needs
* Ministry
* Missions
* Spiritual
* Other

But you can use any categories you like.  You can also rearrange the categories using the arrows and that is the order they will show up on on your handout.

## Archive days

To keep your active prayer list from getting cluttered, we automatically archive prayer requests after a certain number of days.  The default is 21, but you can change it to whatever number you would like here.

## Handout Style

We offer three styles of handouts:  

* **Half letter** prints two handouts on a letter sized piece of paper and is probably enough for most churches.
* **Letter** if you have more prayer requests, you may want to choose letter, which will take up an entire sheet of paper and give you lots of room for requests.
* If you prefer a booklet like a traditional bulletin, you can choose **booklet** and print your requests as a folded buletin.

After you've decided on your settings, be sure to click the "Save Settings" button.
