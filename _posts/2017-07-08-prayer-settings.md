You can change the archive days for prayer in the prayer settings. (Either click the gear icon in the tool list or choose settings from the prayer toolbar.)

To keep your active prayer list from getting cluttered, we automatically archive prayer requests after a certain number of days. Â The default is 21, but you can change it to whatever number you would like here.
