You can change the categories for prayer in the prayer settings. (Either click the gear icon in the tool list or choose settings from the prayer toolbar.)

We use these categories in my church:

* Health Needs
* Ministry
* Missions
* Spiritual
* Other

But you can use any categories you like. You can also **rearrange the categories** using the arrows and that is the order they will show up on on your handout.
