Events added to your site's Google Calendar will show up on your calendar automatically, but are very limited.  You can only see the start and end date and location.

If you want to create a special page for an upcoming event, here is how to do that:

1. Click on Collections.
2. Click on Events
3. Click the `+` button.
4. Give your event a title and hit `enter`
5. Fill out the fields.  The `Page` field will become the body of your event page.
6. If you do not choose to add a `Featured Image` then the default one from `collections/data/settings.yml` will be displayed.
7. Click the save icon.
