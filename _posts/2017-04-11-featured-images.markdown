Good looking images are the heart of any great web design and we've found that the most common pain point for websites is adding images.  To help with that, we do four things:

### A. Keep it simple. (Just two image sizes)

#### i. Featured Images

Any time a field has the term “featured image” in it’s name we are looking for a very specific kind of image. We are looking for an image with a 16x9 aspect ratio. Common 16x9 sizes include 1920x1080 (1080p) and 1280x720 (720p). Images that are this size are the same sizes of standard television screens and are the most common format for slide images.

#### ii. Thumbnails

Any time you see the term thumbnail in a field’s title what we are looking for is a square image. At a minimum, we suggest an image that is at least 150x150 pixels. Thumbnails are almost always pictures of people, and one easy way to get thumbnail images is to reuse twitter or Facebook avatars.

### B. Defaults and fallbacks

Images are an important part of any web design and when your site uses current images - it will really come alive. But if you choose not to upload a custom featured image for a blog post, sermon series or event - we’ve got you covered. Each theme comes with appropriate default images that will display when you don’t want to create your own.

### C. Canva.com links

When you do want to create your own, we highly suggest a service called [Canva.com](http://canva.com). Canva.com is a webapp that makes it super easy to create great looking images. It’s completely free to use unless you decide to use one of their stock images (which are very affordably priced.) Simply open canva and choose the “Presentation (16:9)” template. Customize it to your liking and then click the download button.
