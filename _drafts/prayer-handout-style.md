We offer three styles of handouts:  

* **Half letter** prints two handouts on a letter sized piece of paper and is probably enough for most churches.
* * **Letter** if you have more prayer requests, you may want to choose letter, which will take up an entire sheet of paper and give you lots of room for requests.
* If you prefer a booklet like a traditional bulletin, you can choose **booklet** and print your requests as a folded buletin.

After you've decided on your settings, be sure to click the "Save Settings" button.
